# Card-game-JS
### Short description
>A simple card game with a server side.

### Ruls:
>There is no card on the table, you can play any card (one strength).
If everyone else folds, the table is cleared and a new round begins.

When the table is occupied, you must play by the following rules:
The number (number) of cards that you put on the table should be the same.
The strength of your cards should be higher (that is, the lower the better).

When you have no cards left in your hand, you win the game.

The rank 13 card is a joker card, you can play it with other cards to match the number of cards on the table. There are only two of them.

The card number corresponds to its card strength (except 13).
